# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
a = 16
binary_value = bin(a)
print("The binary representation of", a, "is:", binary_value)
```
## Output

## Result
```
The program successfully converts the number 16 into its binary representation using the built-in bin() function.
